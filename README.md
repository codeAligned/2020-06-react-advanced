# React Workshop

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Each lesson including the exercise description can be found in each of the directories.

I will explain everything during the intro.

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Presentation
2. Q&A
3. Exercise
4. Break

## Code

Most of it is written in TypeScript (not particularily well typed). Feel free to use plain JavaScript if you prefer that.
